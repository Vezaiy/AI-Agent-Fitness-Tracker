Your overall depth is good, but focus on keeping your knees aligned over your toes throughout the movement. Also, work on maintaining that neutral spine position - imagine you're trying to show off the logo on your shirt. 

For your ${metadata.fitnessLevel} level and ${metadata.goals} goals, I recommend practicing bodyweight squats with a focus on these corrections before adding weight. Consider doing 3 sets of 10-12 reps, concentrating on the form cues rather than speed.`,
